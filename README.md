# NLP Assignment - Tokenizer and Model Training

## Task 1: Tokenizer Training
- **Training:** Done by Vinayak and Shiva
- **Testing:** Done by Abhyudaya
- Trained five tokenizers on scraped dataset samples.
- Calculated fertility scores and visualized them with dataset sizes.

## Task 2: Model Training
- **Done by:** Surriya and Vedant
- Adjusted a predefined model architecture to ensure parameters were under 100M.
- Tokenized the dataset with the best tokenizer from Task 1.
