It’s for making things safe, like buying coins online. You put something in a block, and then the block links up with the next one, so nobody can steal it. It’s used in things like Bitcoin, so people don’t get tricked.

She wrote some notes about how a machine could do math or something, and that’s why people think she’s important. But computers didn’t really exist back then, so she was ahead of her time.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35}]}
